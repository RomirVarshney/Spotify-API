# Spotify-API
A personal project, which utilizes the Spotify web API to perform various actions.

As a music producer and mixer, and a brother to someone who does the same, I've often worked with mashups, which involves
taking two popular songs and blending them together, often on the same exact beat. However, finding the right pair is tedious,
because in order to be effective, they should be at very similar BPMs (beats-per-minute) and harmonically linked song keys. In order
to automate the process of finding the right pair, I used the Spotify API in Python to create an algorithm of doing so. Through
entering a specific spotify playlist link, the program pulls Spotify song metrics and creates an algorithm that pairs songs 
based on BPM and song key., and In further updates, I plan on also implementing other Spotify metrics, such as danceability, 
speechiness, etc. to create a more sophisticated algorithm that can further order song pairs based on how optimal they are for
mashups.
